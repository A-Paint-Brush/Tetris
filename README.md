### Controls

Left and Right arrow keys: Move the falling tetromino  
Down arrow key: Start soft dropping  
Up arrow key: Rotate the falling tetromino

Clicking the button in the bottom left corner of the screen pauses the game.

### Rules (in case you've never played Tetris)

Tetrominos will fall from the top of the screen one at a time. While it is falling, you can use the arrow keys to move or rotate it. However, it will lock in place once it has landed on either the bottom of the screen or on top of a block. When a row is completed, it will clear, and all rows above it will move down to fill the empty row. When the settled blocks touch the spawning area, you lose. The objective is to try clearing as many rows as you can before dying.
